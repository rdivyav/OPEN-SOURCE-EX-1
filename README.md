 To create a repository file  http://classroom.example.com/content/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/AppStream http://classroom.example.com/content/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/BaseOS

# Procedure:

Step 1: Start the Terminal: Open the terminal window in your Red Hat Linux environment.

Step 2: Navigate to the YUM Repository Directory. Move to the directory where all repository configuration files are stored, which is /etc/yum.repos.d/.

Step 3: Create a New Repository File. Create a new file named classroom.repo using a text editor with administrative privileges.

Step 4: Add Repository Details. Inside the file, define two repositories — one for AppStream and one for BaseOS — by specifying their names, base URLs, and enabling them while disabling GPG checks.

Step 5: Save and Exit the File. Save the changes made to the file and close the editor.

Step 6: Clean the YUM Cache. Clear any existing metadata or cached data to ensure the new repository information is recognized properly.

Step 7: Verify the Repository Configuration. Display the list of repositories to confirm that the newly created AppStream and BaseOS repositories appear in the output
